I have uploaded my code (without outputs, as Github does not render interactive visuals) for reference, which also contains the following blurb:

To preface this project, please note this is my first time using python for an assignment, and I have virtually no experience wrangling data in this language. I have included a plethora of sources to close the gaps left in class, as this course focused on visualization techniques in Altair rather than how to code in python.

This project's focus is to build a tool that would help environmental/climate experts gain insight to Europe's emissions in the year 2020 by region and country. As I am a beginner in this platform, I chose to use a relatively easy/straightforward dataset to work with -- credits to Github user jonesm198699 for the tidy data I uploaded here.

I held off on analyzing/making conclusione from the data myself, as this is not in scope of the course.
